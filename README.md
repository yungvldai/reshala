A simple CLI tool to resolve `package.json` merge conflicts.
`reshala` automatically finds all of your conflicted `package.json` files.
Also, `reshala` automatically determines version of any dependency and resolves the newer one.
If there will any problems, `reshala` will ask you what to do.

Special thanks to [my colleague](https://github.com/IvanAbramow) for giving a name for this tool ðŸ¤™.
